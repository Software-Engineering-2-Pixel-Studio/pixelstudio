## Description
TBD
(A web-based broswer multiplayer game to interact with your friends and family virtually during COVID-19 pandemic.)

## Core Features
A multiplayer game that provides a playground for everyone to connect and have fun with the community and especially with their friends. Thus, to support this purpose, our game will have these core features. Firstly, **the Co-op Mode** will be available which allows players to support each other in Gameplay. Thus, players can share the joy of fighting off enemies with their comrades. Secondly, **an authorization system** that allows players to create accounts and log-in to play. This feature allows users to have their own profile and they can also customize it based on their styles. Furthermore, our game also provides features in mechanism. **A leveling up system** in gameplay that allows users to make progress and receive some benefits such as tech points, powers, etc.. Lastly, our players will be able to choose their own play style or different strategies based on the situation through a **specialized class system**. For example, players can choose the support class to build towers that have ability to increase damage or the defense class to build fences that block the path until they are destroyed. At the end, with these features we hope our players can enjoy the game and have fun with friends and community.
